# Introduction #

The Beagle Board is a low-cost, fan-less  single-board computer  based on Texas Instruments' OMAP device family, with all of the expandability of today's desktop machines, but without the bulk, expense, or noise. The latest status at [BeagleBoard.org](http://BeagleBoard.org).  Feel free to subscribe to the [Beagle Board RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/BeagleBoard) with your browser now.

# Purpose #

This project, hosted on code.google.com, is meant to address the needs of Beagle Board users needing a reference starting point.  Bugs on the website, board, and reference software are tracked here, as well as proving all of the reference/diagnostic software.
