# Open “Embedded Linux” Software Development with [Beagleboard.org](http://beagleboard.org) #

We are receiving more invites/requests from students across India for similar trainings. We are happy to know the interest but due to limited bandwidth we are finding it difficult to host similar trainings in other cities.

To address growing requests from students in India, we have formed a beagleboard.org volunteer team that is willing to travel to few cities (to start with South India) and do similar trainings.

**Few Perquisites / Requirements are:**

**1. We would like students to do the following necessary arrangements**
> a) Consolidate the (min 100) student list (from multiple colleges preferable)

> b) Mail the list to khasim@beagleboard.org

> b) Students from 2nd year are most preferable

> c) Arrange for a seminar hall, projector system and basic infrastructure for attendees.

> d) Get necessary permissions from College.

**2. No Compulsion from College/Professors - attendance should be based on interest.**

**3. Topics to be covered are**

  * What, why, who, and how of open source
  * Quick overview of the Beagle Board
  * OMAP 3530 internals.
  * How does Beagleboard.org help students & startups in India
  * Q &A and Discuss lab setup to boot Linux on beagleboard
  * Lab #1 (Build and Boot Linux)
  * Validation Procedure for Peripherals on Beagle Board
  * Participating and Contributing to Open Community
  * Open Discussion

**4. Agenda:**

  * Enable Students in India to develop s/w on embedded devices with Open Community.
  * Training students in using the embedded platform for s/w development
  * Give a big picture of what’s going on in the industry with Open Platforms.
  * Benefits of working with Open Community and beagleboard.org in particular.

**5. Audience & expertise:**

  * Students (2nd / 3rd year preferable) with very minimal knowledge of Linux
  * Students who are passionate about Open Source Linux kernel and s/w development for embedded platforms.
