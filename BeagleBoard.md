# Introduction #

The Beagle Board is a low-cost, fan-less  single-board computer  based on Texas Instruments' OMAP device family, with all of the expandability of today's desktop machines, but without the bulk, expense, or noise. Today, participation is limited to a handful of open source developers and universities.  Once there is enough to make the platform suitable for a broader group of developers, you'll be able to find purchasing information and the latest status at BeagleBoard.org.  Feel free to subscribe to the [BeagleBoard RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/BeagleBoard) with your browser now.

For now, [project information is hosted by Google](http://code.google.com/p/beagleboard/). Source files for some projects will be hosted here locally on the [BeagleBoard GitWeb](http://www.beagleboard.org/gitweb). This is only for source where SVN is not suitable for source management.

Current participants are welcome to sign-up on the [BeagleBoard Discussion List](http://groups.google.com/group/beagleboard).  For a "live" discussion, please feel free to join us on the #beagle channel on irc.freenode.net ([irc://irc.freenode.net/#beagle](irc://irc.freenode.net/#beagle)).  You can utilize the [BeagleBoard-hosted Java-based client](http://BeagleBoard.org/chat).

To catch a glimpse of the [BeagleBoard media](http://BeagleBoard.org/media), there are photographs and videos on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/group/beagleboard) and [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/groups/beagleboard/).
