# Introduction #

Some of you may be veteran chatters.  So for you, this may seem trivial.  But I wanted to show others a path to connecting with the Beagleboard chat room.  This room is an excellent way to get quick information for solving problems.  It is almost constantly attended by a group of very knowledgeable Beagleboarders.

# Details #

## Step 1:  Getting the Chat / IM Client Software ##

You likely have heard of Chat / Instant Messaging.  What you may or may not know is that there are several "protocols" for IM (e.g. AIM, Google, IRC, MSN, etc).  The Beagleboard Chat Group is on the IRC protocol.  This cookbook uses Trillian -- a free multi-protocol chat program.  So with Trillian, you can chat with people on many of the protocols at the same time.

  * Download Trillian Basic from the [Trillian home page](http://www.ceruleanstudios.com).
  * Install it.
  * Start it up.

## Step 2:  Configuring Trillian ##

When Trillian starts up, it will put you in the Trillian Preferences Window.  If not, find your way there.  :-)

  * Go to the Identities and Connections tab (tabs on the left).
  * Click on Add a New Connection.
  * Select IRC.
  * Pick a Name (Alias for the Beagle Server) e.g. Beagle Server
  * Click on the ellipsis (...) button to select the actual server you will use.
  * Click on the "Refresh" link in the middle of the window.
  * Double-Click on the FreeNode folder
  * Double-Click on the FreeNode Random Server selection.
  * Enter a Nickname for your self.
  * Enter the same Nickname as your username.
  * If you'd like, enter your full name in the User Info slot.

If you need to operate through a Proxy Server, do the following additional steps:

  * Go to the Advanced Preferences Section (left menu).
  * Go to the Proxy Server Section (left menu).
  * Check the Use Below Proxy Settings for All Services Box.
  * Check the Use Proxy Server to resolve names Box.
  * Check the Use Proxy Server Box.
  * Select HTTP as the protocol.
  * Enter your Proxy Information.
  * Click on Back to Main (left menu).
  * Click on Identities and Connections (left menu).


Now you are likely ready to connect to the server.

  * Click the Connect Button.
  * Almost instantly you should get the blue orb to light up.  If it takes long, you probably have a problem.

## Step 3:  Connecting to Beagle Chat Room ##

Next step is to connect to the Beagle Chat.

  * Double-click on the Trillian icon in your system tray.  This should bring up the Trillian Contacts Window.
  * Right-click on the IRC orb in the lower left of the window.  (There should be the five orbs for the five different chat protocols).
  * Select your Connection (e.g. Beagle Server).
  * Select Join a Channel.
  * Enter beagle as the channel name.

A Chat window should pop up.  And you should be in.

Once you're in, just type something at the bottom window, and it will be broadcast.

IRC uses a very simple command structure.  IRC commands begin with a slash.  [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_commands) has a complete list of all the IRC commands.  There is also a very good beginners list on the [IRC Beginners Page](http://www.ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/ircc-commands.html).
