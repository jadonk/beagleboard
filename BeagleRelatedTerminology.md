# Introduction #

Hello all. This is a documentation of terms I have found while viewing the Beagleboard IRC logs. I have published this in the hopes of helping anyone with Beagleboard terminology and abbreviations. Enjoy and let me know what you think. I also have a blog post where I talk about what I have learned in the IRC logs. Feel free to look at that as well (http://beagleintern.blogspot.com)

|bricked| A BeagleBoard is "bricked" when it no longer boots in its routine way. With this link (http://elinux.org/BeagleBoardRecovery) an explanation is provided on how to recover ("unbrick") a broken BeagleBoard. This is a great advantage of the BeagleBoard, since most closed systems and some open systems cannot be easily recovered once they are "bricked".|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bricked http://www.beagleboard.org/irclogs/index.php?date=2008-10-07#T05:21:12 |
